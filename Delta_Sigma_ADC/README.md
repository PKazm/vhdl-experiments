# Delta-Sigma ADC

This ADC is going to be used in conjunction with the FFT Core and Nokia5110 driver to create an FPGA based FFT plotter, and later on an auto triggering and time scaling oscilliscope.


## Resources Used

limited by device pin frequency to 50Mhz over sample. Configurable data width: 8 bit = 195Khz sample rate.
