# Delta_Sigma_first

This project is very much a work in progress.

This project is for me to learn how a sigma-delta (delta-sigma) modulator works as well as implement it on an FPGA. The Nokia driver (from Nokia5110_Driver_Block) is also included as a way to view the data and waveforms created by the delta-sigma block.

Is this made of magic?

Why isn't it a Libero "Block" as the previous project intended? Because the exported files from the block throw "multiple HDL" errors when I include it in my project.
