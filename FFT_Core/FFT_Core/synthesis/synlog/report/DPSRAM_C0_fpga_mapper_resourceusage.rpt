Extra resources required for RAM and MACC interface logic during P&R:

RAM64x18 Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;
RAM1K18  Interface Logic : SLEs = 36; LUTs = 36;
MACC     Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;

Total number of SLEs after P&R:  0 + 0 + 36 + 0 = 36;
Total number of LUTs after P&R:  0 + 0 + 36 + 0 = 36;
